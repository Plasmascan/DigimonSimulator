# About
This project was made for self lerning purposes and to see how making a Tamagotchi-like program would run using C# WPF in the .net environment.

# Digimon Simulator
Digimon Simulator is a C# WPF Application with online multiplayer capabilities that simulates the Digimon V-Pet Tamagotchis from the 90's. The application is based on the 20th Anniversary editions of the Digivices.
The screen on the Digivice uses a simulated LCD screen to give an accurate representation of the sprites to give a more realistic feel.

# Digital Monsters
Digimon Simulator currently has the version 1 digimon egg with evolutions up to ultimate stage (16 Digital Monsters).
